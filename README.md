# f1-telemetry-hub

F1 Telemetry Hub is a high-performance, cross-platform application designed to visualize and analyze real-time and historical Formula 1 telemetry data. The project combines a modern, responsive frontend built with [Lynxjs](https://lynxjs.org/) and a robust backend developed in [Go](https://golang.org/). Containerized using Docker and deployed on Koyab, this solution is optimized for scalability, performance, and efficient development workflows.

## Features

- **Real-Time Telemetry:**  
  Stream live telemetry data via WebSockets for instantaneous updates.
  
- **Historical Data Analysis:**  
  Query and visualize historical telemetry using interactive charts.
  
- **Cross-Platform UI:**  
  Developed with Lynxjs to ensure a seamless experience on web, mobile, and desktop.
  
- **High-Performance Backend:**  
  Powered by Go to ensure concurrency and reliability in data processing.
  
- **Containerized Deployment:**  
  Docker-based deployment for easy scaling and environment consistency on Koyab.

## Architecture Overview

- **Frontend:**  
  Built with Lynxjs, the UI leverages a rich set of pre-built components for rapid development. It integrates dynamic visualization libraries (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js) to render telemetry data effectively.

- **Backend:**  
  Developed in Go, the backend processes real-time data using efficient concurrency patterns. It exposes RESTful APIs for historical data and WebSocket endpoints for live updates. Time-series databases such as InfluxDB or TimescaleDB are recommended for data storage, with Redis for caching.

- **DevOps & Deployment:**  
  The entire stack is containerized using Docker, with orchestration via Docker Compose during development. The deployment on Koyab simplifies scaling and provides a robust environment for continuous integration and delivery.
